Cyber Architect, Network Architect, Gray Hat Hacker, Junior Python Programmer

For the record im all self taught school is literally the most pointless thing to ever be created in this world, i was forced to go to post-secondary and graduated with a 3.9 GPA in network engineering, network security, virtualization, cloud server admin, etc. 
If you have to go to school to learn something you dont want it bad enough. I am still studying the architect portions of everything in cyber, network and hopfully software. I am open to jobs and am looking myself. I will post my code for a vewing in my github. 
I taught myself for not too long of a time, at the end of the day its how bad do you want it and to be great, welcome to my journey, btw "Reaper" is the codename cyberspace name.
